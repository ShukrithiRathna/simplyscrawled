								<!-- <h3>“Who is (are) your role-model(s) or inspiration in life?” </h3> -->
								<p>  Friends, parents, siblings, family members, teachers, spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, BFFs, classmates or neighbours.   There are so many different relationships that exist in our lives. But more often than not, it doesn’t really matter, what you name the relationship between two people. In other words, the “name”, does not really define how important that person is to you, how much of a role they play in your life or vice-versa.   </p>

								<p>What makes one person more special to us than another is a mystery, and a question that I don’t think can ever have a “correct” answer. It varies from person to person.  After all, who said you need a reason to like someone?  Sometimes, you like a person, ‘just cause’, and that’s that. No reason or explanation necessary, and to be honest, you couldn’t come up with one even if you tried. </p>
								
                                <p>The point of this article is not to ponder the possible reasons for liking someone, but rather to muse about the different kinds of people that exist in our lives. With the advent of technology, it has become so much easier to keep in touch with people, and make contacts, many a time to the extent that we remain virtually in touch with people we will never meet in person again, and frankly don’t even need in our lives. </p>

								<p> Thinking about it, each one of us will have at least one person in our life that come under each of these categories:   </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The kind of people, we to talk to every day, else our day is incomplete. In some cases, it might just be because we live with them, or meet them every day. But even if you don’t, you make contact. It might just be a simple “Hey, what’s up?”, a two-line text, a two-minute phone call, or even just exchanging a joke or two, but it’s there all the same. The funny thing is, often you don’t even realize it, especially in cases where you don’t meet every day. But looking back, you find that you end up talking to that person almost every single day, and you can’t really imagine life without him or her. </li>
                                    <li>The people whom you may or may not talk to, meet daily or monthly even, but they play a major role in your life. How often you make contact is insignificant.  You can even go ages without talking, but they will always be there for you, and vice-versa. Most importantly, it doesn’t matter how long it’s been since the last time you spoke to each other, the conversation starts off, right where you left it, no preamble, no awkwardness whatsoever. And of course, you always end up feeling better than when you started. </li>
                                    <li>We are quite fond of certain people in life, but don’t really feel the need to talk to them every day. People whom you catch up with once or twice a week or month, and ask what they’ve been up to. It usually isn’t a serious conversation, but it makes you feel good all the same. Unfortunately, the problem here is that sometimes too much of a time gap becomes a deal-breaker and you end up feeling awkward, with no idea what to talk about when you finally do meet or try to strike up a conversation. </li>
                                    <li>A person you think of only when you’re in trouble or need help with something. When you’re in a tight spot, this person bails you out, and that’s the end of it. No contact until you reach the next set of crossroads where you need directions. Kind of sad, but true.</li>
                                    <li>A person you talk to very often, almost every day, but if you think about it, he or she doesn’t really mean all that much to you. Sure, they entertain you when you’re bored and have nothing to do, but other than that...meh.  </li>  
                                    <li>Someone you aren’t fond of, frankly can’t stand, but put up with just to be polite or because you don’t have a choice. </li>
                                    <li>Your acquaintances. There’s not much to be said here, except that it’s just the occasional “Hello, how are you doing?”. But these people do play a role in your life just the same. </li>
                                  </ul> 
								<p>Instead of giving names to our relationships, let’s think about the different kinds of people that play roles in our lives. You might just find out that you’ve been giving the wrong person too much attention and ignoring the one who really matters. But most importantly, what kind of person are WE in someone else’s life? Are we really what we think we are?  </p>
