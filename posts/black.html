								<h3>“Who is (are) your role-model(s) or inspiration in life?” </h3>
								<p>  Whether it was the topic of a grade-school moral-science assignment, a question asked during the introduction session in a new class, with a new teacher, or part of the small talk with the aunty and uncle who came to visit, this is one question all of us have been asked as a kid.  As a child, the most popular answers to this question usually were: your mother, your father, your elder sibling if you had one. In case you were sandwiched between both your parents on the couch, then – “Amma, Appa, rendu perum, both are my role models.”  For the more knowledgeable ones with a bit of G.K., read “nerd”, (Just kidding!) maybe the answer was “Abdul Kalam”, “Kalpana Chawla”, “Einstein”, “Sachin” or “Rajnikanth”.  While all these are perfectly good answers, if asked the same question today, most probably, this isn’t what we would say.</p>
								<p>It’s not that these people aren’t inspiring anymore. It’s more like these aren’t the ONLY people who are inspiring. Instead of looking only at beauty, brains, money, or fame, we also search for other values. That single person who is everything we hope to be in the future doesn’t really exist anymore. Instead, we pick out little bits and pieces from different people and put them all together to make that one person, we consider our ideal self.</p>
								<p>Now, here’s the problem, at least for me, but I think it’s the same story everywhere – with an extremely diverse set of family members and friends, who have conflicting ideas and personalities, how do you really decide what sort of characteristics your ideal person should have?</p>
								<p> That “mama oda paiyan or ponnu (cousin)” your parents are always talking about – we’ve all heard the story – has a huge list of achievements, got into IIT/the best medical college, got a really great job and is moving to America/Europe – “Why can’t you be like that?” is the refrain in every family conversation. Sometimes, it even works the other way. There exists one person you are advised NOT to become like. Next, there’s the extremely fun, out-going, trendy cousin who is always encouraging you to just have fun and live life. Then, the cousin/sibling who is always studying. The one “goody-goody” who’s the pet of the entire family, and is referred to as the quiet, calm, and obedient one.</p>
								<p>The down-to-earth, practical father who’s always cautious about everything and advises you to do the same, and the Periappa who urges you to do just the opposite. After all, what’s life if you don’t take a few risks? The superstitious and religious mother, who’s also an early riser and the logical and scientific Periamma (Aunt) who loves to sleep in. The “Peter” who behaves like he was born and brought up in America and the Anna (elder brother) who’s favourite song is “Sopanna Sundari”.  Don’t forget about the Akka (elder sister) who falls exactly in between these two. The Athai (aunt) who knows all the best restaurants in town and the Aachi (grandmother) with the most delicious home-made recipes. The techno-savvy Thatha (grandfather) and the equally old-school Mama (uncle). Your soft-spoken cousin who rarely speaks up and the other one who’s never afraid to voice her opinion. So many people telling you what to do and twice as many  extremes and opinions. </p>
								<p>Growing up as one of the youngest in a huge family, one important thing I’ve learned is that sometimes, there’s no pre-defined right or wrong.   What’s black in one person’s opinion will most always be white for someone else. So, how do you decide what to do, and whom to follow? The answer? Don’t choose black or white, but grey instead. There’s no such thing as the correct shade of grey, and that’s why it’s perfect.  We can add as much black or as much white as we want, till we get the right combination. With more than a million different shades of grey out there, keep blending and mixing, adding in all the little bits that you think are the best qualities of the people around you. Keep going till you find the one shade that’s perfect for you, for that ideal person you want as your role-model and that amazing person you want to become. </p>
								<p>Trying to find my perfect shade of grey, </p>
