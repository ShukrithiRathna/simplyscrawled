								<h3>“Who is (are) your role-model(s) or inspiration in life?” </h3>
								<p>  From seniors at school to freshers at college… 

                                    Never ending tuitions, exams, practicals, and projects. Constant advice from elders about the importance of that one year. So much to do but so little time to do it in. I am sure all of us remember our twelfth grade of school, all too well. It’s been almost one full year since we finished school now, and looking back over this past year, I realized how much things or more particularly, we, as people have changed. Some people might say, somewhere between our days as seniors at school and freshers at college, all of us grew up. While that may be true, I feel that we have somehow lost our way in life. Wondering what I mean? Let’s rewind a bit and look at ourselves as we were a year back… </p>
                                    
                                   <p>Dreaming  about the ideal college life with a ton of aspirations and  high hopes to excel academically,  as well as in extra curricular activities and about the  perfect social and love life  we’ve always wanted. Abundant ambitions, dozens of desires, and the passion and eagerness to achieve it all. </p> 
                                    
                                   <p>On the other side of things, promises to keep in touch forever! Nostalgic conversations reminiscent of all the memories we’ve shared in the years that have passed. Assurances that nothing will change between us, even after we all get into different colleges. Tons of group-fies with captions about how great life is, hash tags like #BFFS, #friendsforever #bestdaysoflife #love etc. Basically, we were all teenagers with lots of hopes, dreams, and good wishes for the future. But most importantly, there was happiness, peace, and love in the air. </p> 
                                    
                                   <p> Now, let’s fast forward to the present and look at how we are today… </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Average to shitty marks in class, crappy social life, breakups, heartaches, almost non-existent relationships with those who were once our best friends and some of us have even lost our identity in the process.  Now, Instagram and fb profiles are filled with selfies and captions like #trustnoone #lovehurts #trustgetsyoukilled etc. and life in general seems to have taken on a negative theme which seems to say “Realized, none of your dreams can actually come true? Congratulations, you’ve grown up now. Welcome to the real world!”, a world where nothing and more importantly no one is permanent, a world where it’s each man for himself, a place where trust gets you hurt and most importantly a world where there are problems galore, and all our dreams and visions for the future seem unattainable. </p>
                                    
                                  <p>  Is this really true? Somewhere along the way in our search for the “perfect” life, we’ve all given up on our dreams and hopes, and conveniently termed it as “growing up”.  Is this really where we want to be or have we lost our way in life a bit?  Is the world around us really that bad? No, not really. What has changed over the past year, isn’t really the rest of the world, but ourselves. Our attitude towards life. The worst part is, we just don’t give a damn about anything anymore, but blame it all on our surroundings. If you want to make things work in your life, you’ve got to put in the effort, be it a friendship, relationship, academics or even the pursuit of a passion. Spend some little extra time catching up on all the things you’ve missed out this past year. Instead of playing the blame game, work on trying to fix the problems, work on changing your life one baby step at a time. Call up that best friend whom you haven’t spoken to in ages. Re-plan your goals for the future (academics, sports or otherwise). Take the initiative to join that language class or guitar class you’ve been wanting to try since forever. </p>
                                    
                                   <p> I am sure if we look deep within , we can revive ourselves. Get back our lost identities, and bump up our self-esteem.  Get back our “younger” selves, if you want to call it that. So, let’s dispel this aura of negativity and get back on track. Let’s chase our dreams and turn them into a reality. Just because the past didn’t turn out the way you wanted, doesn’t mean that the future can’t be better than you imagined! Keep fighting and don’t give up till you find your true self again. Don’t give up till you find happiness again! </p>
